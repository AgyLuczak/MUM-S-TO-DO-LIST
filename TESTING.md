### Code Validation

- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

I used W3C Validator to test all HTML pages. Initially, the validator showed a few unclosed or stray tags and a nesting issue with a paragraph under <h5> tag on a landing page. The remaining errors are a result of using a Jinja template.

### CSS

- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

I used W3C CSS Validator for the CSS. Initial results showed errors around the 'progid' property. This one is a part of the code pasted from the gradient generator. After removing that property, the only error flagged by the validator is that the property 'font-display' does not exist. It is however a valid property, which either indicates that the validation tool is outdated or does not recognise this value in the particular context it's been used in.

### Python and Jinja Syntax

- [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

I have used the PEP8 CI Python Linter application to test my Python and Jinja syntax. The initial results showed a lot of white space and lines of code that were too long. After formatting the code, the validation still flagged some lines as too long. I decided to leave them in their original format as breaking them down could harm the clarity of the code.
